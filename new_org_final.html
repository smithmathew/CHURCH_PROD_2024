                            There is no evidence as to when the prayer groups of the church has been formed. 
                            But it is firmly believed that the prayer groups existed from the start of the 20th 
                            century. To make the functioning of the prayer groups more efficient, 
                            the prayer groups were divided according to their wards. Currently there are 
                            14 prayer groups effectively functioning under the church and their main aim is 
                            to organize and lead the spiritual activities 
                            of the church and to ensure the unity and harmony among the families belonging to church.

                    <p>
                            The foundation for O.V.B.S in the church was laid by the then seminary student Rev. Fr. K. V. Thomas Kochuparackal, by arranging bible classes during the mid summer vacation in 1972. First classes were conducted for students residing near to the church. Then in 1975 the classes were conducted in M.G.D. High School, Puthussery named as the Kallooppara unit. For the first three years classes were conducted only for a week and book published by C.S.S were used for the classes. Then in later years the duration was extended to 10 days. Kallooppara, Kadamankulam, Changaroor, Vallamal, Madathumbhagom churches participated in the classes. As the number of students increased it became impossible to conduct classes in a single unit. So in 1983 two units were formed, one at our church and the other at St George Orthodox Church, Chengaroor.
                    </p>  <p>Today around 300 students are participating in Kallooppara unit. The ever increasing number of students attending O.V.B.S in the church is an example of the dedication shown by the church members towards O.V.B.S.
