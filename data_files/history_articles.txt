Kallooppara, the land with a redundant whilom history : Kallooppara, the land with the most divine touch of tranquility and peace, yet flaunting its most envious beauty through the majestic beauty of the tall, swaying coconut groves in the light and the soul-relishing breeze is a sight that can make anyone think of 'Kingdom Come'. This land which is bestowed with these divine gifts is set most appropriately at the central part of the turquoise blue waters of the river Manimala, by length, that originates from the Peruvanthanam hillocks, which in its due course joins with the well-known river Pampa at  Keecherivalil of pulikeezhu in Thiruvalla taluk.(The river Manimala is evidently known as 'Vishaghna' in a few of the ancient Sanskrit Literature).<br><br>The land of Kallooppara was previously known by the name of <b>Perumbranadu,</b> which was so called due to its massive storage  of rocks and hence being known by the name of&nbsp; '<b>Perum Parra Nadu</b>', in the previous days and gradually being known as Perumbranad, in the latter days as legend has it.<br><br>'Kallooppara' was once the part of Thiruvalla taluk and with the formation of the Pathanamthitta district in 1983, a new taluk was chipped up by the name of&nbsp; Mallapally taluk&nbsp; and Kallooppara became a part of it. This prosperous land of Kallooppara was once governed by the Royalties of the Thekkumkoor Dynasty and Edappally Thampurans (rulers), who always had a deep concern and love for their subjects, who in turn did feel the same. A land with no class demarcation and love and respect for all was a model that we can cherish and learn from even today.

The kalari and the fort in the footsteps of history : The old <b>'Vemolinad'</b> was separated into <b>'Vadakumkoor'</b> and <b>'Thekkumkoor'</b> in A.D.1100.&nbsp;Kottayam, Chenganacherry, Thiruvalla, Kanjirapally and some places of high range where included in Thekkumkoor kingdom.<br><br>Kallooppara was under the control of the Thekkumkoor dynasty. It had <b>Kalari</b> (training center for material arts) at Kallooppara. The famous Kalari was known as Thekkumkoor fort which existed till recently.&nbsp;The Thekkumkoor army camped here and it was risky for the enemy to attack them. The King had many close friends in Kallooppara and its surroundings, it is said. The Old Nair lord Family at Koipuram in Eraviperoor was in close touch with the Kings. It was this Nair Lord family who had great influence on the king and inspired him to donate Kallooppara sub-division to Edappally dynasty.<br><br>As the withdrawal of Thekkumkoor kings, Kallooppara came under the Edappally dynasty, which is also known as <b>Elangalloor Swaroopam</b>. The Edappally dynasty has the history of elevation of a temple priest to the royal position of a King. The founder of the Edappally dynasty was a priest of Thrikkakara temple according to the historical evidence and proverbs.

Tracing the roots to edappally : Kallooppara is known for its religious harmony between all the sects of god loving souls be he a Nair, a Christian, or a Muslim. People of this land have lived in peaceful coexistence from time immemorial.<br><br>Master craftsmen belonging to the the Viswakarma clan were brought to Kallooppara from Edappally, and hamlets of the then Thirukochi, now known as Kochi, for parting their craftsmanship in the construction of temples like Kallooppara Devi Kshethram, Thelliyoorkavu, Porittikavu and <b>'The legendary Kallooppara St Mary's Church'. </b><br><br>Though the Christians devotees of Kallooppara claims their roots to the first century, history dates their arrival and settlement at Kallooppara only from the 9th century onwards. Most of them migrated&nbsp; from Christian centers like Kuravilangad, Vaikom, Kadambanad etc..<br><br>As history has it, in the earlier days the Christian believers of&nbsp; Kallooppara had to depend on the '<b>Niranam Church'</b> for the holy mass ceremonies, funeral ceremonies and other religious rites. The journey on Vallom(small boat) through the Manimala and Pampa rivers was tedious, tiresome and risky.<br><br>The much renowned Edappally Kings used to spend their time in the famous and explicably beautiful&nbsp; Elangalloor Maddom, rich in its architectural antiquity, that once existed on the north side of the river Manimala. A abode for the royal guests that was once well-equipped with a private pool called the '<b>Kullipura Mallika</b>'&nbsp; equipped with granite rock paved steps carved with excellent craftsmanship to the Manimala river, can still be seen now in Angadikadavu of Puramattam panchayat.<br><br>It is said that once while the ruling king of Edappally was having his rest in the Elangalloor Maddom, he happened to see a few number of people coming on a vallam singing melodious hymns accompanied by prayers. The king immediately came down to the river bank to observe the sight more closely and found it to be a burial procession, with the body on the the floating hearse covered with a white cloth. The procession that started from Manimala were going to <b>Niranam Church </b>for the funeral of the dead, since in those days Niranam Church was the only Christian church in central Travancore.<br><br>This event moved the Kings heart and having realized the hardship of the Christian subjects, he virtually pointed a plot on the other side of the river, and gave sanction to bury the body and built a church. This generous act and the love of the king resulted in the gathering of the Christians and religious harmony in the land evermore than before. <br><br>Though all this there are many indications in the church's and family's histories, there are no clear evidence for the origin and age of the church.<br><br>The founding stone was consecrated on Malayalam month <b>3rd Karkadakam</b>, it is said. The stone day of the church is being celebrated on that day. It is commonly believed that the founding stone of the present church was laid on Malayalam month <b>Karkadakam 3rd of 515</b> (A.D.1339.).<br><br>There are no clear evidence of the origin of the church but it is believed that the church had the same age as the origin of Edappally dynasty. The Christians coming from Manimala, Vaipur and Kottangal who were once the members of the Great Kallooppara Church ,established Vaipur St. Mary's Church 600 years ago.<br><br> The study of the archaeology department reveals that church was constructed in the   2nd millennium. The sculpture and figure carved in wood indicates the church's age. Some letters carved on the slab of holy place of the church also traces back to the origin of the church. Though the letters have faded out, they are believed to be of the earlier century.

The devoted souls of the malankara church : The Great Kallooppara Church follows the tradition of Malankara Church which was established by St.Thomas, one of the Apostles of Jesus Christ. The members of the church recognize and respect the spiritual leaders who led the ancient Malankara church. But unfortunately with the arrival of Vasco De Gama in 1498, South India came under Portuguese rule and every effort was made to convert Malankara Church into Roman Catholic Church. The effort of the Roman missionaries succeeded in their attempt by the Udayamperoor holy Synod in 1599.<br> <br> The Christians who where discontented under the Roman influence assembled in 'Koonan Kurish' in 1653 and made a solemn declaration reiterating their wholehearted support, loyalty and confidence in the Malankara Church. The church was split into two sects known as <b>'Puthen Koot'</b> and <b>'Pazhaya Koot'</b>. The members of the Kallooppara Great church stood firmly with the 'Puthen Koot' sect.<br><br>When the Antioch Patriarch tried to bring Malankara Church under his &nbsp;control&nbsp;in the 19th century, the members of the great church declared support to Malankara Metropolitan and stood in their belief.

Kallooppara parish in the pages of malankara orthodox church : After the '<b> Koonan Kurish </b>' Declaration it was the Mavelikara Synod of 1836 that enabled the believers to assure their confidence in the Malankara church. It was the Vicar of Valiya Pally who took initiative in introducing the document known as <b>'Mavelikara Padiyola</b>'. Kallooppara church could prevent the members from renovation and affix them in their traditional belief. It is to be noted that the members of the church could participate in Koonan Kurish declaration of 1653 and' Udayamperoor' Synod of 1599.

The legacy of the 'mavelikara padiyola' and kallooppara church : Adangapurathu <b>Fr. Joseph </b> was the senior priest of 'Kallooppara Valia Pally'. He was one of the four priests who was nominated for bishop after the expiry of Bishop Punnathra Mar Divannasios. Cheppad Mar Divannasios was elevated as the bishop and Fr.Joseph became his loyal advisor. <br> <br> British supremacy came into existence in Kerala in the beginning of 19th century. Colonel Munroe the resident of Kerala took interest in the affairs of the orthodox church,   which determined the fate of the church. The traditional belief of orthodox church was questioned. The disagreement between the bishops and missionaries entered into open conflict. Dr. Wilson, the bishop of Kolkatha came to Travancore for the unity of the two sects&nbsp;and put forward some suggestions. The delegate conference of the Malankara church assembled in Mavelikkara to consider the suggestions. The conference rejected the suggestions of bishop Wilson and adopted an important document known as '<b>Mavelikara Padiyola'</b>. Joseph priest was the strong supports of Mavelikkara metropolitan is the delegate conference and the declaration. It is believed that Joseph priest was cremated at the north Chamber of the holy place of the church.

Renaissance of the kallooppara church : The renovating idea of 'Palakunnathu Abraham Malpan' created some conflict in the church. It was '<b>Kalloor Philipose Cor Episcopa</b>' who protected the church from renovators. It was also he who represented Kallooppara church in the 'Mulanthuruthy synod'.

The exigent period for the church : His Holiness Abdullah Patriarch of Antioch visited Kerala and dismissed Malankara metropolitan Vattasseril Geevarghese Mar Divannasios that created a great crisis in the Malankara church and lead many cases in the churches. The members of the Kallooppara church supported the stand of Malankara bishop Vattasseril Metropolitan.<br><br>It was unfortunate that church was closed for many years owing to cases and two sects had separate chapels for worship. But Bishop Puthenkavil Geevarghese Mar Pilexinos took initiative in solving the problems and as a result Valia Pally was opened.

The case, decree, and the verdict : The church case was an unfortunate event in the Malankara church which had far reaching consequences. Two sects were waiting for the result of Supreme Court judgment of 1958. The members of the Valia Pally decided to buy a plot near the church for the construction of a new church thinking whether the court judgment would be against them. <br><br> But by the grace of God, Supreme Court judgment was in favour of Malankara Metropolitan. A massive victory rally was held which shook the whole area of Kallooppara.
