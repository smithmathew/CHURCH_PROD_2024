					<td><p align="justify">St. Mary�s Orthodox Church, Kallooppara, the Pilgrim Center of St. Mary has been a source of spiritual enlightenment for people in and around Kallooppara for the past 700 years.  After the declaration of the church as a pilgrim center, Holy Mass and prayer is being conducted on every Wednesday. Hearing about the miracles that have happened and the blessing received by many, thousands of pilgrims are visiting the church every month.  <br><br>Due to this never ending flow of pilgrims and request made by many to have an opportunity to participate in mass prayers, the <b>church authorities have decided to organize a mass prayer named �Abhayam�  on the first Wednesday of every month. The �Abhayam� prayer meeting was inaugurated on 2nd December 2009 by His Grace Dr. Yoohanon Mar Chrisostamos.</b><br><br> We welcome people from all walks of life to come and participate in �Abhayam� and receive and feel the blessings of Holy Mary.</p></td>
