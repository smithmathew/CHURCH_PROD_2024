					<td><p align="justify">Kallooppara is the land with the most divine touch of tranquility and peace. Kallooppara is known for its religious harmony between all the sects of god loving souls be he a Hindu, a Christian, or a Muslim. People of this land have lived in peaceful coexistence from time immemorial. The  swaying of the majestic and tall coconut groves in soul-relishing breeze is a sight that can make anyone think of 'Kingdom Come'. This land which is bestowed with these divine gifts is set most appropriately at the central part of the turquoise blue waters of the river Manimala, that originates from the Peruvanthanam hillocks, which in its due course joins with the well-known river Pampa at  Keecherivalil of Pulikeezhu in Thiruvalla taluk.</p>

This prosperous land of Kallooppara was once governed by the Royalties of the <b>Thekkumkoor Dynasty and Edappally Thampurans (rulers)</b>, who always had a deep concern and love for their subjects, who in turn did feel the same. A land with no class demarcation, love and respect for all was a model that we can be cherished and learned from even today.</p></td>

It had a Kalari (training center for material arts) unit at Kallooppara. The famous Kalari was known as Thekkumkoor fort which existed till recently. The Thekkumkoor army camped here and it was risky for the enemy to attack them. It is said that the King had many close friends in Kallooppara and its surroundings. The Old Nair lord Family at Koipuram in Eraviperoor was in close touch with the Kings. It was this Nair Lord family who had great influence on the king and inspired him to donate Kallooppara sub-division to Edappally dynasty.</p></td>
